# Company User Interface

## Introduction
This project is a user interface (UI) that was designed and developed for a biomedical company focused on imaging. Every component is functional and was designed with the help of project managers, marketing teams, and physcians. The UI was designed and programmed by me over a span of 6 months, with the goal of catering physians during active surgery. The middle component with the two circles (images) was not redesigned.

## Technologies Used
  - C#
  - XAML
  - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
